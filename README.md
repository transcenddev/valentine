# Valentine's Day App

A simple application created to impress your loved ones this Valentine's Day. Share the love and spread joy with a beautifully crafted app!

## Setup

To get started with the app, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install PNPM Globally

First, make sure you have [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) installed globally to manage your project dependencies. Run this command in your terminal:

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser. Typically, it will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if configured differently).
